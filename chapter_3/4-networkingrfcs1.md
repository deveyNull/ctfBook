# Networking RFCs 1

RFCs or Request for Comments, is the way that the internet develops standards. Read this to learn more: [https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-internet-request-for-comments-rfc-4092366](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-internet-request-for-comments-rfc-4092366) We talked about them a bit in the Representing Data section.

Now the important thing is how to read an RFC.

* From the organization that approves RFCs. [https://www.ietf.org/blog/how-read-rfc/](https://www.ietf.org/blog/how-read-rfc/)
* This is short and sweet but applies to just about any technical document: [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/179022/how-does-one-read-rfcs-and-similar-documents](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/179022/how-does-one-read-rfcs-and-similar-documents)
* Skim the HTTP RFC to answer a few questions: [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt)
* Is this an official RFC? What RFC did it update?
* What does this RFC give guidance on how to do?
* What are the 5 families of response status codes?  
* What is a GET request and what does it look like?
* What is a User-Agent?
* What RFC guides "cache-control" in a header?

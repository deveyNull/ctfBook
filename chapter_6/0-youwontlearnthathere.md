# You Wont Learn That Here

In a controversial move, I don't believe this is a beginner topic! I think it is a major shortcoming of the community that we pretend this is something beginners should be able to figure out by themselves.

Before even attempting a reversing or exploitation problem a student should have a full understanding of C and assembly. It is very possible to fake it, and write buffer overflow exploits without knowing what a jmp instruction is \(I certainly did\), but we do a disservice to students by acting like this stuff is on the same level as the other materials taught in this course.

If you are angry at me for saying this, or have a better idea, let me know! Email me at d.m.devey@gmail.com or in Slack.

When I get around to writing an Advanced CTFs course I will have plenty of Reversing and BinEx... and a knowledge of C and Assembly will be non-negotiable pre-requisites.

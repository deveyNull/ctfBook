# Programming and Scripting 

[Check out our free CTF Course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=566)

We are assuming you have some Python experience. 

Much like the previous section, "experience" is a fairly amorphous concept. 

To determine if you have enough Python experience, ask yourself if you are able to write a basic web-scraper, download the results into a CSV, and then run logic on those values. If you think that sounds easy, move on ahead. If you think that sounds a little beyond your current ability, check out <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>. We are working on having a quick course to go over this, but it is still in progress. 

If you don't know Python (or another scripting language well), check out <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python>. It is Python2 (which is no longer actively maintained), but it is a wonderful course and will teach you everything you need to know about Python. The only difference is that print statements can look slightly different. You'll be fine. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
